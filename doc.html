    <h2>Project 1 Prototype</h2>
    <p>I want the page to be pink in order to fully embody myself. But, the colors I add with the pink need to take some of the edge off so it isn't glaringly pink. I want the majority of the site to be centered. Maybe a cursive font for my name? The navbar and my name should go in the sam line, as well. A faded photo of my resume (as a preview) would be cool, it would add some flair to the page. My p and h1 elements should have the same color, and h2 can be different. I'm going to split the page up into sections based on content, so header, navbar, about, thumbnails, projects, contact. I'll use a google form for the contact.  I'll put the project thumbnails next to each other. Same with my picture and my about me. The rest will be stacked in a way that should fill the screen with each individual element. I'll need a tag on most things. I'll try to add as many grids as I need, definitely one for the thumbnails and the about section.</p>

    <h2>Final submission</h2>
    <p>We're moving the contact form into main in order to make room for my actual contact details in the footer. I'd like them centered but in a row next to each other. After that, we'll weork on responsiveness. <br> Ideally, we'll have two designs: one for larger screens and one for smaller screens. We'll work with what we've got for screens in between and add more media queries if necessary.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I know that for my media query for smaller screens, everything will be relatively the same, but the photos will be stacked on top of their descriptive content (if they aren't already). This will (hopefully) make it look better on mobile screens by not bunching it all up next to each other.</p>
