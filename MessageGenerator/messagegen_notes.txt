have a message already
loop through the alphabet to find each letter in the message
message depends on a prompt from the user

plan!!
- ask for user's name (first and last)
- is name saved?
	- if not, save name (you'll need a file for this)
	- if it is, find the message related to it

---this is a menu---
- ask user if they want to write a message
	- if they already have one, ask if they want to overwrite it
		- if yes, overwrite
- ask user if they want to read/print message
	- this is where we do the "loop through the alphabet" thing
- ask user if they want to save current message
	- if yes, save file
- ask user if they want to exit
	- if yes, say goodbye and end program
---end of menu---

save name and message info to a dictionary

---function planning---
what do we need to be able to do?

- read in file
- write to file
- loop through alphabet + print to console
^^^make that a method

probably use the unicode characters for the punctuation

there's a code for spaces (of course) so rewrite original array population loop to include spaces, numbers, and punctuation
